Here is one of some exercises I've been practicing for the Udacity Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer 6 month program.

Examples here: https://codepen.io/momomartin/

Check some cool games like "Dark-Arcade-Game" and "Memory-Psycho" or learn what's happening in Iceland's volcanoes with "Ice-Rock-Map", one nice animal mimicry trick with "Animal Trading Card" or learn a bit about myself with my "portfolio"
